Hi there! I am Aditya Kane and this website contains my blog posts, publications and projects.
<br>

## What's new?

- Our paper "[An Efficient Modern Baseline for FloodNet VQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15025)" is accepted at ICML NewInML Workshop 2022!
- Our paper "[Transformer based ensemble for emotion detection](https://aclanthology.org/2022.wassa-1.25/)" is accepted at ACL WASSA Workshop 2022!

## A bit about me...

I am a senior Computer Engineering undergrad at Pune Institute of Computer Technology, Pune. 


I'm currently working as a Research Intern at IISc, Bengaluru under the guidance of Dr. Suresh Sundaram and Dr. Chandan Gautam. Mainly working on Out-of-Distribution detection in NLP. 


I frequently contribute to the Keras ecosystem. My contributions are aimed towards adding meaningful components that improve user experience, something that Keras stands for. Apart from that, I'm usually squashing nasty bugs in the code. I have summarized my contributions on the "[Open source](https://adityakane2001.github.io/opensource/)" page.
