You are probably here, because you want to know more about me, Aye ?
Hi there! I am Anshuman Mishra.
<br>

## A bit about me...

National Institute of Technology, Warangal will graduate me as Electronics Engineer, but my passion lies in Next Gen Computer Science

I'm currently interning as a software engineering at Bank of New York, Mellon.

I frequently contribute to the open source projects that are revolve around Deep Learning. My contributions are aimed towards adding meaningful components that improve user experience. I want to become Applied ML Scientist / Engineer and solve interesting problems ! Blogging is my new hobby and I'm very active on Kaggle and often write kernels.
