Kaggling, has become a verb in itself ;), is my hobby. I have been an active part of Kaggle community since October, 2022.
This page summarizes my contributions to Data Science community of Kaggle.

My kaggle profile is [@shivanshuman](https://www.kaggle.com/shivanshuman).

Currently on kaggle I'm rated as

1. Datasets Expert

2. Competitions Contributor

3. Notebooks Expert

4. Discussions Expert

# Competitions

Kaggle competitions span months and tough competition in the global data science community makes them hard to participate.
I find them fun. My notable achievements are following :

1. My team **Kuch Bhi** recieved Bronze medal (stood 99th /936 teams) in G2Net [Detecting Continuous Gravitational Waves](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/g2net-detecting-continuous-gravitational-waves/leaderboard)
