This page summarizes my open source contributions. 

## Deepchem

KerasCV is a repository of modular building blocks (layers, metrics, losses, data-augmentation) that applied computer vision engineers can leverage to quickly assemble production-grade, state-of-the-art training and inference pipelines. 

My contributions to KerasCV include the following [Pull Requests](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+repo%3Akeras-team%2Fkeras-cv+author%3AAdityaKane2001&type=Issues). Some of the important ones include RandomResizedCrop (a.k.a. Inception crop, Stochastic Depth and porting over models from `keras.applications` to `keras_cv.models`.


## Other projects

I have contributed to small projects like [pytorch-retinanet](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+repo%3Ayhenon%2Fpytorch-retinanet+author%3AAdityaKane2001&type=Issues) (a PyTorch implementation of the  RetinaNet), [SmallPebble](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+user%3Asradc+author%3AAdityaKane2001&type=Issues) (a see-through autodiff library written in Python), [awesomo](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+repo%3Alk-geimfari%2Fawesomo+author%3AAdityaKane2001&type=Issues) (a collection of interesting projects).
