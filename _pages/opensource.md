This page summarizes my open source contributions. 

## Keras

KerasNLP is a natural language processing library that supports users through their entire development cycle

My contributions include
    * [Refactoring](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-nlp/pull/673) : Contributed to a big change in Keras' API
    * [AlbertClassifier](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-nlp/pull/668) : Adding Classifier for Alberta Backbone Model
    * [Bert Feature Extractor](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-nlp/pull/631) : Never got merged, but pointed out a Flaw in KerasNLP's design

## FluxML

Flux is a 100% pure-Julia stack and provides lightweight abstractions on top of Julia's native GPU and AD support. It makes the easy things easy while remaining fully hackable. 

My contributions include
    * [UNet](https://github.com/FluxML/Metalhead.jl/pull/210) : Implemented a UNet for Metalhead.jl (Flux's official model zoo) with best practices in Julia.

## Deepchem

[Deepchem](deepchem.io) is a library which is on a mission of democratizing Deep-Learning for Drug Discovery, Quantum Chemistry, Materials Science and Biology
 
My contributions to deepchem include the following [Pull Requests](https://github.com/search?p=1&q=is+repo%3Adeepchem%2Fdeepchem+author%3Ashivance&type=Issues). The important one is porting CNN to PyTorch from Tensorflow.


## Other projects

I have minor contributions to project like 
* [deepmind/optax](https://github.com/deepmind/optax/pull/413) (a gradient processing and optimization library for JAX.)
* [Ivy](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy/pull/5205/files) (The Unified Machine Learning Framework).
